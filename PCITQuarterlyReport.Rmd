### **Outreach Tip** 


One staff shared that her PCIT began attending open houses with HeadStart at the beginning of each school year. These outreach efforts led to increased referrals from teachers, and increased familiarity with the program in parents who were referred. Finally, after connecting with teachers across multiple HeadStart locations in Lane County, Options was asked to provide a PCIT training at an all-day inservice training for HeadStart staff.

**Training Updates**  
With the new biennium of funding for the PCIT expansion, 32 new counselors in 13 new and existing sites enrolled in and completed the first phase of PCIT training. We are so excited for this new wave of folks working to support children and families across the State of Oregon.
